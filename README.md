## Packages/Dependencies Used
### swaywm and co. (major UI elements)
- wm: [`swayfx`]([https://github.com/swaywm/sway](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx)) (forked from [`sway`](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) for rounded corners, shadows, and a few more enhancements)
    
> [!NOTE]
> The config files for sway depend on GNOME's GTK4.0 theming for `libadwaita` apps (i'm a GNOME departee!), as well as for user authentication within `nautilus` (via `polkit`). You may want to remove/rewrite those portions accordingly).
- main bottom bar: [`waybar`](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- lockscreen: [`swaylock`](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock) (not shown, plain :) )
- notification daemon: [`dunst`](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst)
